The Micro Java Virtual Machine Kernel is a portable preemptive real-time kernel with an integrated CLDC java virtual machine designed for embedded systems

Provides a full-fledged java development environment for your real-time embedded system. 
Capable of running any combination of native and java tasks in tandem. 

### Preemptive real-time micro operating system
* Preemptive priority based scheduling and weighted CPU time sharing
* Synchronization and wait lists with notification and timeouts enabled by monitors
* Real-time with low interrupt latency and response
* Dual-purpose heap for explicit memory allocation and release as well as exact mark-and-sweep garbage collection

### J2ME CLDC java virtual machine brings the Java language to your wireless or embedded platform
* Full support for the CLDC virtual machine and class librairies
* Floating point supported and configurable to the processor's floating point capabilities
* Advanced threading and process model for a complete separation of java applications into distinct memory spaces

### Additional features
* Very small size
* Built in romizing support
* Fully self contained, no additional libraries required
* A second java thread scheduler enables JVM to be run on an existing O/S
