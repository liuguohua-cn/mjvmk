The package consists of two parts:
-a small OS
-a java CLDC interpreter VM

The OS must be ported to a particular system.

The package has been tested running on x86 machines from a floppy disk.  The OS has been tested as a stand-alone
microkernel.  
The java vm has been tested running on top of the OS, as well as running in windows as a windows application.
This was made capable since the VM can run with kernel-level threads or user-level threads.  User level threads
allow the VM to run as a standard windows application, allowing for advanced testing of the VM.  Kernel level threads
allow for the VM to run directly on an embedded system.
